    <h1>Old Firefox Icon:</h1>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="The Old Firefox Icon: A red fox wrapped around the Earth">
    <p>The above image is of the previous Firefox icon. In 2019, Firefox released a new, slick icon.
        The new icon makes the fox less prominent by morphing it more into a 'swoosh'. The change was 
        partly made to modernize their brand, but also to create an overarching identity for all
        Firefox products.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of change:</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>modern design</li>
        <li>create overarching brand theme</li>
        <li>media will report on change</li>
    </ul>
